Q: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
---
A: Yes, it allows. Since JAVA has a feature called "Method Overloading", which means two or more methods may have the same name if they differ in parameters (different number of parameters, different types of parameters, or both).

Q1: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
----
A1: Java is always Pass by Value and not pass by reference.


Q2: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
----
A2: Because Java passes all arguments to a method in form of pass-by-value, when passing `jungleDVD` and `cinderellaDVD`, which are two references, only their method copied refs were passed, not the original refs. Therefore, original refs to objs remain unchanged.

Q3: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
---
A3: Because we called out the setter setTitle, it only changed the name of the JungleDVD.
